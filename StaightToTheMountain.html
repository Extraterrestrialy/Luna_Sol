		<p>Luna and Sol are pumped! Luna hasn’t confidently attempted a spell like this before. If Luna can hold it for more than 10 minutes then we’ll be able to attend the ceremony on time!

		<p>“Hey you noticed that Luna?” Asked Sol</p>
		<p>“That the bewitched tower is keeping me anchored?” Replied you who are Luna</p>
		<p>“I believe its because it's a magical item raging with mana” Sol Explained.</p>
		<p>“Yeah that makes sense, It’s easy to latch on to”</p>

		<P>“At the rate we’re going, I think we might even be early!” Shouts Sol with a huge smile.
		<P>“Yeah me too!” Shouts Luna</P>

		<p>“It was an Inspiring adventure we had tonight.” Sol points out “We definitely wouldn't have discovered the potential you have hidden under all that doubt and hesitation”</p>

		<p>“Thank you, I feel as though I understand how my magic works thanks to tonight's trials. I can’t wait to get to the ceremony. I really want to start my specialized training!” Says Luna</p>

		<p>“And what will that be?” Asked Sol.</p>
		<p>“Speed and Protection. I’ll be an arrow and a shield!” Luna says excitedly, with a wonderful expression on her face.</p>
		<p>Sol grins a wholesome grin, he proud of his human buddy/master</p>
