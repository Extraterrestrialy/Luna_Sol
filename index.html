		<h1>Luna & Sol's Halloween Adventure</h1>
		<p>Every year on October 31st, 13 year old witches around the world receive their last lesson before doing specialized magic. The problem here is that our little witch Luna is running late and won’t make it to the site on time. For those who don't attend will have to wait a whole year before they can start to do specialized magic.</p>

		<p>Luna has doubts of herself since she can't hold a spell for long but hopes that once she starts to specialize she could train to gain more stamina.</p>

		<p>So she quickly puts on her cloak, hat and boots. Her familar known as "That Cat Named Sol" usually comes along for the ride. With her broom in hand and bag strapped on, she was ready to make way for the tallest mountain just out side of town. At the very top is where her last class will be held.</p>

		<p>As Luna makes her way out the door to the balcony, Sol meows for her attention. He is warning her of an upcoming storm. We can still make it on time if we take the broom but the train, might be safer… </p>
