		<h1>You Decide To Head Straight Towards The Mountains</h1>

		<p>In retrospect it seems like the fastest way but with all this heavy rain weighing you down can you really make it?

		<p>Sol is seeking shelter in your cloak but Luna yourself might get awfully sick from this.
		The Thunder is frequently and the lighting seems as if its chasing you</p>

		<p>Lighting strikes the tip of broom and you start to lose your balance (and lose your hat)</p>

		<p>"This weather is crazy!! You think we can seriously make it?" Exlaims Sol.</p>
		<p>"Of course we can! Just you see"Says you who are Luna</p>
		<p>You try your best but you're awfully low. You can barely see the mountains through the clouds. Fortunately you're low enough to see The Bewitched Power Lines in the distance. It'S acting haywire!</p>

		<p>It is common knowledge that these power lines lead right to the moutains. Witches need interent too y'know. But you're awfully tired, luckily theres a train station nearby. Although taking a 5 minute rest under a canopy won't hurt anybody...</p>
