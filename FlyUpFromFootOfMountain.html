		<h1>Flying Up From The Foot Of The Mountain</h1>
		<p>You look up in awe. The Mountain is very high. Luna highly doubts she’ll be able to fly up in time.</p>
		<p>“Is supposedly a 5 minute fly up to the top. The storm died down a bit but its still unpredictable” Said Sol.</p>

		<p>You try your best to make it but the wind keeps blowing you into branches making you lose your balance. Unfortunately time is running out and the destination is so near yet so far away.</p>

		<p>Its Unfortunate but the clock tower strikes, Indicating it is now 8 PM but you wouldn’t arrive for another 5 minutes.</p>

		<p>Tardiness is absolutely not tolerated by one bit in spell class but the haphazard pumpkin randomly shows up in class (somehow before me) and vouged for me</p>

		<p>He said he saw my trip to make it here and believes I deserve to complete my lesson today based off what he saw.</p>

		<p>My teacher, Ms.Blair for some reason, highly respects this peculiar pumpkin.
		She decided to continue with my specific lesson on the New Year that's coming in a few months. That's better than having to wait a whole year !
		Ms.Blair told me to take these 3 months and train really hard to make it in time for the private ceremony. I have to prove to her that this is not a mistake!</p>
