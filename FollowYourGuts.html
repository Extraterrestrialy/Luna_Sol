		<h1>You followed your instincts</h1>
		<a href="index.html">Star Over</a>
		<p>You end up getting out the forest, You’re all wet and tired but you somehow managed to exit the forest. The only problem is that you're still not at the foot of the mountain. Its still pouring but fortunately the sound of the train is at the distance.</p>
		<p>“Hey, maybe we can catch that train? I’m sure it's heading towards the mountain”</p>
		<p>You’re hesitant. The rain is making you sick and the train can relieve you but you only have about 15 minutes left. Finding the train would take 3 minutes from where you are and the ride will take 8 minutes. Then to fly to the top could take a few minutes.</p>

		<p>“You can either catch a breath here and find a way towards the mountains, or take the nearby train thats already in route to the mountain and take your chances flying to the top of it on time” Says Sol in a somewhat annoyed tone.</p>
		<p>What should you, who are Luna, do?</p>
